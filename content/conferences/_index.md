## Our Conference
The H-LRF has been hosting annual conferences since 2019, bringing together researchers from around the world to share cutting-edge research in lexical studies and applied linguistics.

All conferences since 2020 have been held online via Zoom. Our conferences are usually held in September and span 2-3 days, featuring keynote presentations, research talks, and opportunities for academic networking.



## Participation
The conferences are open to H-LRF members and non-members alike. Non-members interested in attending are encouraged to register in advance and may also consider joining H-LRF.

We aim to provide a supportive atmosphere for both established and emerging researchers, fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing in the field of lexical research.

## Previous Conferences

Below are a list of the conferences we have hosted since our first conference in 2019. Each conference has featured distinguished keynote speakers and cutting-edge research presentations.

Our conference archive showcases the evolution of lexical research and the growing international community of vocabulary acquisition researchers.
