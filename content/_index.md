<h2 class="card-title-underline">About Us</h2>
The Hiroshima Lexical Research Forum is a closed group for vocabulary researchers to share and present ideas. Our members range from world-renowned experts to beginning students. We are focused on providing resources and services to supervisors who are looking to help their supervisees develop their research skills. While our home base is Hiroshima, our membership boasts a truly international presence, with members residing in New Zealand, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom. Our environment is supportive and rigorous, catering to researchers at all stages of their careers, from beginners to those with years of experience. The annual online H-LRF conference is held over three days every summer. We have been fortunate to have several esteemed keynote speakers present groundbreaking and innovative research at our event, which has greatly benefited from their contributions. We are dedicated to providing support to early-career researchers and PhD students through mentorship and guidance from our renowned experts.

<h2 class="card-title-underline">Conferences</h2>
We held our first H-LRF conference in 2019 on campus at Hiroshima University. While the H-LRF conference began in person, COVID made it necessary to move to an online format. The online H-LRF conference has since taken place each September over three days. We have been fortunate to hear some prestigious keynote talks, and ground-breaking and cutting-edge research some of which we've seen our members publish in leading academic journals. Our aim is to support early-career researchers and PhD students with help from world experts.
